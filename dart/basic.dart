   * Below are built-int types in Dart:
   * 
   * Numbers (int, double)
   * Strings (String)
   * Booleans (bool)
   * Lists (List, also known as arrays)
   * Sets (Set)
   * Maps (Map)
   * Runes (Runes; often replaced by the characters API)
   * Symbols (Symbol)
   * The value null (Null)
   * 
   * Other types
   * Object: The superclass of all Dart classes except Null.
   * Enum: The superclass of all enums.
   * Future and Stream: Used in asynchrony support.
   * Iterable: Used in for-in loops and in synchronous generator functions.
   * Never: Indicates that an expression can never successfully finish evaluating.
   * dynamic: Indicates that you want to disable static checking.
   * void: Indicates that a value is never used.
