// - [x] Change the test so a caller can specify how many times the character is repeated and then fix the code
// - [x] Write ExampleRepeat to document your function
// - [ ] Have a look through the strings package. Find functions you think could be useful and experiment with them by writing tests like we have here. Investing time learning the standard library will really pay off over time.
